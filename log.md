##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts** This was a really enjoyable experience for me. I'm a project-based learner, so going through a meticoulus task such as the Recipes project helped me develop a much deeper understanding of the material than I would have thought.

### Day 2: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts** For some reason, it was tough for me to understand the material today. I had to look at multiple YouTUbe videos in addition to the course material in order to wrap my head around it. Thankfully, after starting the exercises included within the program, I started to understand the material a lot more. Again, I'm really enjoying The Odin Project's project-based learning approach, it reminds me a lot of my coursework from university.
