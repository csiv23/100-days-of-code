# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: This was a really enjoyable experience for me. I'm a project-based learner, so going through a meticoulus task such as the Recipes project helped me develop a much deeper understanding of the material than I would have thought.

### Day 2: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: For some reason, it was tough for me to understand the material today. I had to look at multiple YouTube videos in addition to the course material in order to wrap my head around it. Thankfully, after starting the exercises included within the program, I started to understand the material a lot more. Again, I'm really enjoying The Odin Project's project-based learning approach, it reminds me a lot of my coursework from university.

### Day 3: June 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Foundations, Inspecting HTML and CSS, and The Box Model modules from the [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) CSS Foundations course.

**Thoughts**: Today I furthered my progress with developing with CSS. I applied the CSS learnings from the previous lesson into the recipes project from Day 1. Additionally, I learned how to utilize Chrome Dev Tools to inspect and edit webpages, along with understanding the Box Model through exercises in the css-exercises repo.

### Day 4: June 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Block and Inline module from the [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) and completed the required CSS exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on learning the difference between block and inline elements, and completed the required exercises relating to margin and padding. The Box Model was the first part of the curriculum that challenged me, which although frustrating, I consider a good thing. I used other online resources such as YouTube when I was stuck on the exercises, and I eventually made my way through them.

### Day 5: June 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Introduction to Flexbox, Growing and Shrinking, and Axes modules within [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) curriculum and worked on the corresponding exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day working with Flexbox, and it's hard to wrap my head around it. Although I understand how its useful and I see why I will be using it a lot in the future, I'm having trouble picking it up. 

### Day 6: June 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I have reached my knowledge peak. Today was the first time I got stuck on one of the exercises. I looked for other resources online, and found [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/), which helped me review my knowledge of Flexbox. I looked at someone walk through the exercise that I was having difficulty with, which helped me a lot. People online said Flexbox gets easier over time, so hopefully I'll get the hang of it as I complete more exercises.

### Day 7: June 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I was really frustrated, so I went into today with mixed feelings about Flexbox. I continued to work on the exercise I was stuck on, but I couldn't get it to work no matter how hard I tried. I consulted a variety of content from YouTube to further understand Flexbox, such as [this walkthrough of the exercise from Jaybees Tech Talk](https://youtu.be/B4HS13jyvk8), [Enavo Tuts' "A Comprehensive Guide to Flexbox Alignment](https://youtu.be/B4HS13jyvk8), and [Kevin Powell's "Learn flexbox the easy way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU). All of these resources were helpful in teaching me more about Flexbox, but I still couldn't figure out my issue. I still haven't given up, but I'll try again tomorrow. 

### Day 8: June 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I figured out my issue. It was from within the html file, where I didn't have an element inside a class it should've been. Although this originally made me feel frustrated, I'm used to dealing with small issues like this in programming, so it's nothing new to me. Today I worked on The Landing Page project from the CSS curriculum. Additionally, I found another resource, [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/), to help me with learning Flexbox further. It's my favorite resource I've used so far.

### Day 9: June 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), worked on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises.

**Thoughts**: I worked on the landing page project for a bit, but I decided that I'd complete the Flexbox Zombies exercises first because I wanted to have a deeper understanding of the properties of Flexbox before I used them in a project. I can't say enough good things about the game, it really teaches you how to use Flexbox and figure out common problems well. I got stuck on some of the problems related to flex-grow and flex-shrink, but I eventually figured them out. 

### Day 10: June 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today I continued working on Flexbox Zombies, and got through four of the chapters which covered flex-basis, flex-order, flex-wrap, and align-content. I decided to take a break from the Landing Page project for today, but I'm going to get back to it tomorrow. 

### Day 11: June 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished work on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises, worked on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I am SO happy I took the time to go through Flexbox Zombies. Working on the Landing Page Project felt like a breeze. I have one more section left to do, but I'm so happy with how its turning out. I feel like I fully understand Flexbox, so I'm ecstatic. I can't wait to finish up the project tomorrow. 

### Day 12: June 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished work on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I ended up taking a break from coding. I had a lot of stuff going on in my personal life, and still felt kindof burnt out. To make up for it, I decided that today I will finish the landing page project, regardless of how long it takes. Safe to say, it's done! It was kindof a burden to fix all of the small inconsistencies with the project, and to be fully honest I think it has a long way to go. However, I'm proud of where it is right now. Tomorrow, I begin learning about Javascript, and I'm pumped. I have experience with back-end from school, and I'm looking forward combining it with my new front-end knowledge.

### Day 13: June 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS Fundamentals Parts 1, 2, and 3 from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Today was a lot of review for me. Most of the content I went through today involved functions and data types within JavaScript, which I already knew a lot about from previous programming courses. However, I did end up learning some new concepts, specifically Function Expressions, Default Parameters, and the JavaScript Call Stack. I watched some videos to deepen my understanding, such as [this Function Expression video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37ly8tCGFWA), [this Default Parameters video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1AjzDN_eHA), and [this JacaScript Call Stack video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8AeMrVtFLY). All of them were very helpful. Additionally, I learned about Chrome Dev Tools today. I didn't realize how in depth the Dev Tools were, and I realize now why they are viewed as such a big asset to web developers. As I spend more time on my projects, it is crucial that I have a deep understanding of them, so it was good that I learned about them today.

## Days 14 - 20: June 14-20, 2022

**Progress**: Completed Project for [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/) Application.

**Thoughts**: The past week I've worked on a project for Sandbox, a student-led software consultancy affiliated with Northeastern University. Although I am unable to put the code in here, I worked on developing the back-end of a javascript application using the Express framework within Node.js. This was a very new experience to me, so I had to do a lot of research. However, I learned more in this week than I have ever had before. Overall, I'm really happy with how my project turned out, and I think that the project made me much more comfortable with using Javascript.

## Day 21: June 21st, 2022 

**Progress** Completed Rock, Paper, Scissors project from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), set up GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day back working through The Odin Project, and today's project felt like a breeze compared to my Sandbox application. Besides that, I set up GitHub pages, so I am now able to host the sites I create on my profile. This makes me really happy, as I can more easily display my work. I am really excited to keep working through the coursework of The Odin Project, and I can't wait to work on it tomorrow.

## Day 22: June 22nd, 2022

**Progress** Read from DOM Manipulation and Events module from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com)

**Thoughts**: Today I learned about DOM Manipulation and events through Javascript, and it was overwhelming. This combined with me deciding to code later in the day caused me to really not want to code today. In order to get myself to understand the material more, I followed along with Wes Bos' tutorial [Make a JavaScript Drum Kit in Vanilla JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego). This video was really helpful, but I think I'm going to work on finding more resources so I can understand the concepts more.

## Day 23: June 23rd, 2022

**Progress** Worked on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

**Thoughts**: Today I worked more on the Rock, Paper, Scissors project where my goal is to successfully implement DOM methods into the functions that I had created previously. I'm not fully confident on my understanding of DOM methods, so this project will be a great way to get me more practice with them. So far, I've been able to add a new class to the HTML successfully, but I'm having issues displaying the store and the game's results. It's frustrating, but I like that I'm able to reassess my design decisions.

## Day 24: June 24, 2022

**Progress** Continued work on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

**Thoughts**: Today consisted of a lot of playing around with the design of my code. So far, I'm really dreading using JS with my websites. Restructuring my program takes a lot of time and a careful thought process, but it's worth it at the end. Today, I was able to get my score to display along with the result of the game. All that's left to do now is to add logic to end the game at a certain score and to make it look presentable.

## Day 25: June 25, 2022

**Progress** Continued work on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

**Thoughts**: Today I added in the logic to end the game when the score reaches 5, and I also began the process of creating a better UI with CSS. As of today, I'm officially a quarter of the way through the challenge. This is a huge milestone! It's been really hard to be consistent so far, but I'm happy with the progress that I've made. I can't wait to see what I will accomplish in the next 75 days.
