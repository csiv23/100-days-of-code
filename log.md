# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: This was a really enjoyable experience for me. I'm a project-based learner, so going through a meticoulus task such as the Recipes project helped me develop a much deeper understanding of the material than I would have thought.

### Day 2: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: For some reason, it was tough for me to understand the material today. I had to look at multiple YouTube videos in addition to the course material in order to wrap my head around it. Thankfully, after starting the exercises included within the program, I started to understand the material a lot more. Again, I'm really enjoying The Odin Project's project-based learning approach, it reminds me a lot of my coursework from university.

### Day 3: June 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Foundations, Inspecting HTML and CSS, and The Box Model modules from the [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) CSS Foundations course.

**Thoughts**: Today I furthered my progress with developing with CSS. I applied the CSS learnings from the previous lesson into the recipes project from Day 1. Additionally, I learned how to utilize Chrome Dev Tools to inspect and edit webpages, along with understanding the Box Model through exercises in the css-exercises repo.

### Day 4: June 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Block and Inline module from the [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) and completed the required CSS exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on learning the difference between block and inline elements, and completed the required exercises relating to margin and padding. The Box Model was the first part of the curriculum that challenged me, which although frustrating, I consider a good thing. I used other online resources such as YouTube when I was stuck on the exercises, and I eventually made my way through them.

### Day 5: June 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Introduction to Flexbox, Growing and Shrinking, and Axes modules within [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) curriculum and worked on the corresponding exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day working with Flexbox, and it's hard to wrap my head around it. Although I understand how its useful and I see why I will be using it a lot in the future, I'm having trouble picking it up. 

### Day 6: June 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: WOrked on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I have reached my knowledge peak. Today was the first time I got stuck on one of the exercises. I looked for other resources online, and found [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/), which helped me review my knowledge of Flexbox. I looked at someone walk through the exercise that I was having difficulty with, which helped me a lot. People online said Flexbox gets easier over time, so hopefully I'll get the hang of it as I complete more exercises.
