# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: This was a really enjoyable experience for me. I'm a project-based learner, so going through a meticoulus task such as the Recipes project helped me develop a much deeper understanding of the material than I would have thought.

### Day 2: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS Foundations course from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: For some reason, it was tough for me to understand the material today. I had to look at multiple YouTube videos in addition to the course material in order to wrap my head around it. Thankfully, after starting the exercises included within the program, I started to understand the material a lot more. Again, I'm really enjoying The Odin Project's project-based learning approach, it reminds me a lot of my coursework from university.

### Day 3: June 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Foundations, Inspecting HTML and CSS, and The Box Model modules from the [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) CSS Foundations course.

**Thoughts**: Today I furthered my progress with developing with CSS. I applied the CSS learnings from the previous lesson into the recipes project from Day 1. Additionally, I learned how to utilize Chrome Dev Tools to inspect and edit webpages, along with understanding the Box Model through exercises in the css-exercises repo.

### Day 4: June 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Block and Inline module from the [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) and completed the required CSS exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on learning the difference between block and inline elements, and completed the required exercises relating to margin and padding. The Box Model was the first part of the curriculum that challenged me, which although frustrating, I consider a good thing. I used other online resources such as YouTube when I was stuck on the exercises, and I eventually made my way through them.

### Day 5: June 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Introduction to Flexbox, Growing and Shrinking, and Axes modules within [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) curriculum and worked on the corresponding exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day working with Flexbox, and it's hard to wrap my head around it. Although I understand how its useful and I see why I will be using it a lot in the future, I'm having trouble picking it up. 

### Day 6: June 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I have reached my knowledge peak. Today was the first time I got stuck on one of the exercises. I looked for other resources online, and found [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/), which helped me review my knowledge of Flexbox. I looked at someone walk through the exercise that I was having difficulty with, which helped me a lot. People online said Flexbox gets easier over time, so hopefully I'll get the hang of it as I complete more exercises.

### Day 7: June 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I was really frustrated, so I went into today with mixed feelings about Flexbox. I continued to work on the exercise I was stuck on, but I couldn't get it to work no matter how hard I tried. I consulted a variety of content from YouTube to further understand Flexbox, such as [this walkthrough of the exercise from Jaybees Tech Talk](https://youtu.be/B4HS13jyvk8), [Enavo Tuts' "A Comprehensive Guide to Flexbox Alignment](https://youtu.be/B4HS13jyvk8), and [Kevin Powell's "Learn flexbox the easy way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU). All of these resources were helpful in teaching me more about Flexbox, but I still couldn't figure out my issue. I still haven't given up, but I'll try again tomorrow. 

### Day 8: June 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Flexbox exercises from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I figured out my issue. It was from within the html file, where I didn't have an element inside a class it should've been. Although this originally made me feel frustrated, I'm used to dealing with small issues like this in programming, so it's nothing new to me. Today I worked on The Landing Page project from the CSS curriculum. Additionally, I found another resource, [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/), to help me with learning Flexbox further. It's my favorite resource I've used so far.

### Day 9: June 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), worked on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises.

**Thoughts**: I worked on the landing page project for a bit, but I decided that I'd complete the Flexbox Zombies exercises first because I wanted to have a deeper understanding of the properties of Flexbox before I used them in a project. I can't say enough good things about the game, it really teaches you how to use Flexbox and figure out common problems well. I got stuck on some of the problems related to flex-grow and flex-shrink, but I eventually figured them out. 

### Day 10: June 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today I continued working on Flexbox Zombies, and got through four of the chapters which covered flex-basis, flex-order, flex-wrap, and align-content. I decided to take a break from the Landing Page project for today, but I'm going to get back to it tomorrow. 

### Day 11: June 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished work on [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) exercises, worked on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: I am SO happy I took the time to go through Flexbox Zombies. Working on the Landing Page Project felt like a breeze. I have one more section left to do, but I'm so happy with how its turning out. I feel like I fully understand Flexbox, so I'm ecstatic. I can't wait to finish up the project tomorrow. 

### Day 12: June 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished work on Landing Page from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I ended up taking a break from coding. I had a lot of stuff going on in my personal life, and still felt kindof burnt out. To make up for it, I decided that today I will finish the landing page project, regardless of how long it takes. Safe to say, it's done! It was kindof a burden to fix all of the small inconsistencies with the project, and to be fully honest I think it has a long way to go. However, I'm proud of where it is right now. Tomorrow, I begin learning about Javascript, and I'm pumped. I have experience with back-end from school, and I'm looking forward combining it with my new front-end knowledge.

### Day 13: June 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS Fundamentals Parts 1, 2, and 3 from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Today was a lot of review for me. Most of the content I went through today involved functions and data types within JavaScript, which I already knew a lot about from previous programming courses. However, I did end up learning some new concepts, specifically Function Expressions, Default Parameters, and the JavaScript Call Stack. I watched some videos to deepen my understanding, such as [this Function Expression video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37ly8tCGFWA), [this Default Parameters video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1AjzDN_eHA), and [this JacaScript Call Stack video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8AeMrVtFLY). All of them were very helpful. Additionally, I learned about Chrome Dev Tools today. I didn't realize how in depth the Dev Tools were, and I realize now why they are viewed as such a big asset to web developers. As I spend more time on my projects, it is crucial that I have a deep understanding of them, so it was good that I learned about them today.

## Days 14 - 20: June 14-20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Project for [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/) Application.

**Thoughts** The past week I've worked on a project for Sandbox, a student-led software consultancy affiliated with Northeastern University. Although I am unable to put the code in here, I worked on developing the back-end of a javascript application using the Express framework within Node.js. This was a very new experience to me, so I had to do a lot of research. However, I learned more in this week than I have ever had before. Overall, I'm really happy with how my project turned out, and I think that the project made me much more comfortable with using Javascript.

## Day 21: June 21st, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Rock, Paper, Scissors project from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), set up GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day back working through The Odin Project, and today's project felt like a breeze compared to my Sandbox application. Besides that, I set up GitHub pages, so I am now able to host the sites I create on my profile. This makes me really happy, as I can more easily display my work. I am really excited to keep working through the coursework of The Odin Project, and I can't wait to work on it tomorrow.

## Day 22: June 22nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read from DOM Manipulation and Events module from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

**Thoughts**: Today I learned about DOM Manipulation and events through Javascript, and it was overwhelming. This combined with me deciding to code later in the day caused me to really not want to code today. In order to get myself to understand the material more, I followed along with Wes Bos' tutorial [Make a JavaScript Drum Kit in Vanilla JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego). This video was really helpful, but I think I'm going to work on finding more resources so I can understand the concepts more.

## Day 23: June 23rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked more on the Rock, Paper, Scissors project where my goal is to successfully implement DOM methods into the functions that I had created previously. I'm not fully confident on my understanding of DOM methods, so this project will be a great way to get me more practice with them. So far, I've been able to add a new class to the HTML successfully, but I'm having issues displaying the store and the game's results. It's frustrating, but I like that I'm able to reassess my design decisions.

## Day 24: June 24th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project.

**Thoughts**: Today consisted of a lot of playing around with the design of my code. So far, I'm really dreading using JS with my websites. Restructuring my program takes a lot of time and a careful thought process, but it's worth it at the end. Today, I was able to get my score to display along with the result of the game. All that's left to do now is to add logic to end the game at a certain score and to make it look presentable.

## Day 25: June 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Rock, Paper, Scissors Project.

**Thoughts**: Today I added in the logic to end the game when the score reaches 5, and I also began the process of creating a better UI with CSS. As of today, I'm officially a quarter of the way through the challenge. This is a huge milestone! It's been really hard to be consistent so far, but I'm happy with the progress that I've made. I can't wait to see what I will accomplish in the next 75 days.

## Day 26: June 27th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Rock, Paper, Scissors Project.

**Thoughts**: Today I finished up my project by fixing some of the backend functionality and making a basic interface using CSS (specifically flexbox). There were a lot of small changes that I needed to implement from the code the last time I worked on it, so it was interesting seeing how taking a day off opened my mind to seeing new bugs. Thankfully, I was able to fix them and I am now finished with the project.

## Day 27: June 28th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Etch-a-Sketch Project.

**Thoughts**: Today I started my work on the Etch-a-Sketch Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). So far, I've been able to create a grid of div elements, but I am having issues figuring out how to add an onClick() event for them. This project seems to be much tougher than the Rock, Paper, Scissiors project, but I'm looking forward to developing a deeper understanding of JS concepts.

# Day 28: June 29th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Etch-a-Sketch Project.

**Thoughts**: Today I added functionality to change the color of each pixel on the grid by having the mouse hover over them. Additionally, I created a button for clearing the grid. I'm still having issues getting this to function, but I bet I will figure it out soon (hopefully). I also added a button so that a new grid will be generated of a specified size determined by the user's input.

# Day 29: June 30th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Etch-a-Sketch Project.

**Thoughts** Today I fixed the clear button to properly clear the grid, fixed a bug where the grid size would not stay the same regardless of the size of grid created, added a color picker to change the color of the brush, and added some CSS styling to the site. All that's left is to properly style the site, which I really want to focus on doing. I made a lot of progress today and I'm very happy with it.

# Day 31: July 5th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Began work on Pomodoro Timer.

**Thoughts**: Today I began on a personal project to create a pomodoro timer for use when studying. My goal for the project is to make it able to stream music from within the site, which will automatically stop once the timer ends. So far, I've just been able to get the layout up. I plan on picking away at this project little by little this Summer.

# Day 32: July 8th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS exercises, began Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: Today I completed some of the exercises included in [Wes Bos' JavaScript30 series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs) and started work on the Calculator project.

# Day 33: July 11th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Android Studio and Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: As you can tell, I've been all over the place. I've just started Summer classes, and I've also began prepping for interviews with Leetcode. As a result, it's been hard to find the time to get to my projects. I've also felt pretty burnt out on front-end stuff lately, and just finishing a project made me uneager to start a new one. But today, I was able to get back on track. Today, I set up my Android Studio as part of the pre-work for the CodePath Android Development course I'm planning on taking this fall. I spent half of my time today figuring that out. The other half of today I spent working on the calculator project, which was really fun. I was able to get the basic structure of the site set up, and am working on adding functionality for the screen to display the digits from the buttons pressed. I really hope I get back into the swing of things, but getting back on track today was a good first step.

# Day 34: July 12th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: Today I continued the work on my Calculator project, and made a lot of progress. My buttons now work, and I'm able to call operations on two buttons successfully. I still have a few bugs to fix, but I'm really happy with the progress I made today!

# Day 37: July 16th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: Today, I wrapped up the Calculator project by adding keyboard support for the rest of the functions, refactoring some functionality to improve the structure of the code, and added CSS styling. As of today, I have finished the Foundations curriculum of the [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com), and am now ready to move on to the Full Stack JavaScript path. I believe that this 100 day challenge has been a large component of getting me this far, and I'm especially thrilled that I was able to get this far in only 37 days of the challenge. I can't wait to see where the rest of this challenge will take me!

# Day 38: July 17th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum, started HTML Tables Assessment.

**Thoughts**: Today I learned about the structure of HTML tables and worked on the [HTML Tables assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data) by Mozilla docs. I'm almost done with it, I just need to iron out some small bugs.

# Day 39: July 18th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum, finished HTML Tables Assessment.

**Thoughts**: Today I finished up the HTML Tables assessment, and learned about various CSS stylings, such as CSS Units, Text Styles, Advanced Selectors, and Positioning. To learn more about selectors, I used the interactive site [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/), which was a really fun way to learn. Additionally, I watched videos such as Kevin Powell's [introduction to Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmDh3m8b9cU) and Web Dev Simplified's [Learn CSS Position in 9 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU). 

# Day 40: July 19th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum, worked on Calculator project.

**Thoughts**: Today I worked on fixing some bugs within the Calculator project. There's still some minor fixes to be made, so over the next coming days I'll split my time between the coursework and fixing bugs within the Calculator. Besides that, I learned about CSS Variables today, and watched Kevin Powell's [introduction to CSS custom properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHO6TBq_auI).

# Day 41: July 20th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Calculator project and worked through Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum.

**Thoughts**: I spent a majority of my time today fixing bugs within the calculator project, which involved reworking some of the operations I wrote. This was really annoying, but I eventually got it in a much better working state. Additionally, I learned about creating forms in HTML today, and followed along with [MDN's Your First Form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form) tutorial and set up the repository for the Sign-up Form project.

# Day 42: July 21st, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Sign-up Form Project.

**Thoughts**: Today, I worked on the Sign-up Form Project, mostly messing around with figuring out how to position the main elements on the site using CSS (I overcomplicated it a lot, but I eventually figured out the solution).

# Day 43: July 22nd, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Sign-up Form Project.

**Thoughts**: Today, I added password validation to the Sign-up Form Project and fixed the styling. All I need to do now is add a logo to the page. Graphic Design isn't my passion, but I want to make this site look pretty good.

# Day 44: July 23rd, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sign-up Form Project and worked on [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/).

**Thoughts**: Today, I finished up the Sign-up Form project by adding the logo and background, which was a little tricky because I had never overlaid a div onto an image before. Besides that, I began work on understanding grids in CSS, and worked my way through [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/), which was a great intro to Grids.
